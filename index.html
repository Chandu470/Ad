Many research papers have got elaborated with link between fingerprint patterns and Human Brain lobes.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Brain Lobes can be analyzed depending on formation and amount of ridge present in the finger prints.</li>
                        <li>Medical experts confirmed that each person’s finger prints are unique.</li>
                        <li>Fingerprints demonstrate different types of characteristics, even identical twin babies also.</li>
